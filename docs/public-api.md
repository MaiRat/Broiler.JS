# Public API reference

Broiler.JS exposes its public API through .NET assemblies rather than a single monolith. Consumers should reference the smallest assembly that matches their integration point, or `Broiler.JavaScript.All` when they want the aggregate distribution.

## Primary packages and boundaries

| Assembly | Boundary | Public surface to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.All` | Aggregate package | Convenience reference for applications that want the complete engine surface. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Engine` | Execution host | `JSEngine`, `JSContext`, debugger hooks, feature flags, and engine-level extensions. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Runtime` | Runtime values | `JSValue`, `Arguments`, value factories, and runtime conversion helpers. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Parser` | Source parsing | `FastParser` and parser primitives that produce AST structures. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Ast` | Syntax tree model | Expression, statement, pattern, and misc AST nodes used by parser and compiler projects. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Compiler` | Compilation | `FastCompiler` and compiler services that lower parsed programs into executable forms. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.BuiltIns` | ECMAScript built-ins | Built-in object implementations such as `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `Promise`, `RegExp`, `String`, `Symbol`, and typed arrays. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Modules` | Module system | Module registry/cache behavior and module graph execution. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.ModuleExtensions` | Host module extensions | Optional host integrations that extend module loading without coupling them to core execution. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Clr` | .NET interop | CLR binding and conversion services for host-object access. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Debugger` | Debugging | Debugger-facing abstractions and testable debugging support. |
| `Broiler.JavaScript.Storage` | Property storage | Property key and storage primitives used across runtime and engine code. |

## Compatibility promise

The public API follows assembly boundaries: lower-level projects (`Storage`, `Ast`, `Parser`, `Runtime`) must not depend on higher-level feature assemblies. New APIs should preserve this direction so compliance work can improve individual language areas without forcing a monolithic dependency graph.

## Documentation updates for new APIs

When adding or changing a public type, update this file with the owning assembly, the intended consumer, and any compliance impact. If the API implements a specific ECMAScript feature, link the related compliance test area from `docs/compliance/process.md` or record a gap in `docs/compliance/known-gaps.md`.
